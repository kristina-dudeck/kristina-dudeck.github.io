  <h1>Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio</h1>
  <p>Kristina Dudeck | Southern New Hampshire University</p>
  <p>This ePortfolio showcases my projects in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.</p>

  <h2>Milestone One: Code Review</h2>
  <p>
    This section contains my narrated code review video for the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard.
    The review explains the original dashboard structure and my planned enhancements in algorithms,
    software design, and databases.

  <p>
    The original dashboard provided basic functionality but lacked modularization and error handling.
    The enhanced version introduces cleaner callbacks, improved input validation, and a more polished
    user interface, making the system more professional and user-friendly.
  </p>

  <h2>Milestone Three: Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
  <p>
    This milestone highlights my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles.
    Below are links to both the original and enhanced versions of the artifact, plus the narrative.

  </p>
  <p>
    The original artifact demonstrated basic algorithmic functionality. The enhanced version improves efficiency,
    applies more complex data structures, and evaluates trade-offs in design choices, showcasing my growth in
    computational problem solving.
  </p>

  <h2>Milestone Four: Databases</h2>
  <p>
    This milestone highlights my ability to design and implement secure, efficient database solutions.
    Below are links to both the original and enhanced versions of the artifact, plus the narrative.

  </p>
  <p>
    The original artifact provided basic CRUD operations but lacked indexing, validation, and secure credential handling.
    The enhanced version introduces query optimization, input sanitization, robust error handling, and environment‑based
    credential management, making the system more professional, reliable, and secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

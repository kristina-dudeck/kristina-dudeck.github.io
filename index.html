  <h1>Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio</h1>
  <p>Kristina Dudeck | Southern New Hampshire University</p>
  <p>This ePortfolio showcases my projects in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.</p>

  <h2>Milestone One: Code Review</h2>
  <p>
    This section contains my narrated code review video for the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard.
    The review explains the original dashboard structure and my planned enhancements in algorithms,
    software design, and databases.

  <h2>Milestone Two: Software Design & Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard demonstrates my work in software design and engineering.
    Below are links to both the original and enhanced versions of the artifact, showing
    how I improved modularization, error handling, and UI/UX design.

  <p>
    The original dashboard provided basic functionality but lacked modularization and error handling.
    The enhanced version introduces cleaner callbacks, improved input validation, and a more polished
    user interface, making the system more professional and user-friendly.
